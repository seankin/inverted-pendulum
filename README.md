# Inverted Pendulum Project 

This project was used along side studying my Engineering degree specialising in Electronics to learn about control theory and physics in a practical way. 

#explain the control theory prolem 
The inverted pendulum or cart pole is a classic problem in control theory.

#hardware and material requirements 

-PLA driven by a DC motor via a toothed belt
-3D printer 

-rotary encoder opposite the motor (acts as a pulley for the belt and allows us to track the motion of the cart)
-second rotary encoder on the cart is a pivot for the pole and measures its angle. 

-The motor is controlled by a 32 amp Sabertooth motor controller.

-Monitored the encoders with an Arduino.

- piece of extruded aluminum rail called V-Slot, (1.5 m long)

# Materials 

-V-Slot Linear Rail â€“ 20x20mm - Clear Anodise, 1500mm
